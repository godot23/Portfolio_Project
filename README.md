# Jason's Portfolio (URL: https://godot23.github.io/Portfolio_Project/)

## Description

This webpage is meant to serve as a portfolio to showcase the work I will be completing over the next 11 weeks. This is in order to help employers find my work more readily. 

## Usage
The links at the top will lead to each corresponding section. Once I have a project to upload, the links on the pages will lead to the relevant project's page.
